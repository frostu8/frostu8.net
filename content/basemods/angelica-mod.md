Roland wants to meet Angelica. Angela struggled to rebuild Angelica, but she
was welcomed anyways in an unstable state.

**This reception does not drop combat pages.**

This project was started on January 18, 2021. There have been many changes and
adjustments since then.

It may not be properly balanced, but I hope you will play it anyways just for
fun.

The person who helped with the key page artwork and background is the person
who uploaded the workshop items with the 1st and 2nd highest number of 
subscriptions on the workshop.
